/*
 * CSE 220 Homework 6, Part 3 tests: wildcard search and replacement.
 *
 * Name:
 * SBU ID:
 *
 * Write at least 5 tests of your own here. The two samples below are only
 * examples, so they do not count toward the 5. Worth covering: a prefix
 * pattern, a suffix pattern, a word at the very start of a line, a word at the
 * end of the file, a word surrounded by punctuation, an invalid pattern, and a
 * star in the search text with no -w, which is an ordinary search.
 *
 * Quote your patterns. These tests reach your program through system(), so an
 * unquoted *n is expanded by the shell against the working directory, where it
 * happily matches the bin folder.
