/*
 * CSE 220 Homework 6, Part 2 tests: simple search and replacement.
 *
 * Name:
 * SBU ID:
 *
 * Write at least 5 tests of your own here. The sample below is only an
 * example, so it does not count toward the 5. Worth covering: a replacement
 * that changes the length of the line, a search term that appears inside a
 * longer word, a term that appears several times on one line, a line range
 * that starts and ends on the same line, and a range whose end is past the end
 * of the file.
 *
 * A test that checks the output file needs an expected file at
 * tests.out.exp/<test_name>.out.txt. Write it by hand, or generate it with a
 * command you trust and read it carefully before saving it.
